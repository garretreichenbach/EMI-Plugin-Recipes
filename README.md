# EMI Plugin Recipes
## Introduction
Many server-side plugins on Minecraft Servers add custom recipes, blocks, and items. These items are typically not compatible with recipe viewer mods,
and as such it becomes difficult to find the recipes for these items. This plugin aims to solve that problem by adding these recipes for many common
plugins to EMI so that they can be viewed on the client. This mod is pure client-side and does not require any server-side installation. You simply
have to enable which plugins the server has in the config file and the standard recipes for that plugin will be added to the viewer.

Note: If a server happens to have custom recipes for a plugin (i.e. the recipes added by a plugin are changed from their defaults), you can add and
modify these recipes in the config file or via the in-game menu. This system also allows you to add recipes for plugins that are not currently
supported by the mod.
